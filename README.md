# Webcam Security

A Python package for webcam security monitoring with Telegram notifications. This package provides motion detection capabilities with configurable monitoring hours and automatic video recording.

## Features

- üé• Real-time motion detection using webcam
- üì± Telegram notifications with snapshots
- ‚è∞ Configurable monitoring hours (default: 10 PM - 6 AM)
- üé¨ Automatic video recording on motion detection
- üéµ Audio recording with video (combined MP4 format)
- üßπ Automatic cleanup of old recordings
- üñ•Ô∏è Live preview with monitoring status
- üöÄ Easy-to-use CLI interface

## Installation

```bash
pip install webcam-security
```

```bash
uv pip install webcam-security
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Configuration

First, set up your Telegram bot credentials:

```bash
webcam-security init --bot-token "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" --chat-id "YOUR_CHAT_ID" --topic-id "OPTIONAL_TOPIC_ID"
```

### 2. Start Monitoring

```bash
webcam-security start
```

### 3. Stop Monitoring

```bash
webcam-security stop
```

## Configuration

### Required Parameters

- **Bot Token**: Your Telegram bot token from @BotFather
- **Chat ID**: The chat ID where notifications will be sent

### Configuration json:
This configuration file (`config.json`) contains all the settings required for the webcam-security system to function. Each field controls a specific aspect of how the monitoring and notifications work:

- **bot_token**: The Telegram bot token you get from @BotFather. This allows the system to send you notifications via Telegram.
- **chat_id**: The unique identifier for the Telegram chat (group, channel, or user) where alerts and recordings will be sent.
- **topic_id**: (Optional) If you are using a forum-style Telegram channel, this specifies the topic/thread for notifications.
- **monitoring_start_hour**: The hour (in 24-hour format) when monitoring should begin each day. Default is `22` (10 PM).
- **monitoring_end_hour**: The hour (in 24-hour format) when monitoring should stop each day. Default is `6` (6 AM).
- **grace_period**: The number of seconds to keep recording after motion is last detected. This helps capture the full event. Default is `25` seconds.
- **min_contour_area**: The minimum size (in pixels) of detected motion to trigger recording and notifications. Helps filter out small, irrelevant movements. Default is `500`.
- **motion_threshold**: The sensitivity of motion detection. Lower values make the system more sensitive to small changes. Default is `25`.
- **recording_fps**: Frames per second for the recorded video files. Default is `20.0`.
- **cleanup_days**: The number of days to keep old recordings before they are automatically deleted to save disk space. Default is `3`.

You can edit this file directly to fine-tune the system‚Äôs behavior. The file is typically located at `~/.webcam_security/config.json` in your home directory. Make sure to keep your bot token private and do not share this file publicly.


### Optional Parameters

- **Topic ID**: For forum channels, specify the topic ID for organized notifications

## CLI Commands

### Initialize

```bash
webcam-security init --bot-token "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" --chat-id "YOUR_CHAT_ID" [--topic-id "TOPIC_ID"]
```

### Start Monitoring

```bash
webcam-security start
```

### Stop Monitoring

```bash
webcam-security stop
```

### Help

```bash
webcam-security --help
webcam-security init --help
webcam-security start --help
webcam-security stop --help
```

## How It Works

1. **Motion Detection**: Uses OpenCV to detect motion in the webcam feed
2. **Monitoring Hours**: Only processes motion during configured hours (default: 10 PM - 6 AM)
3. **Notifications**: Sends Telegram messages with snapshots when motion is detected
4. **Recording**: Automatically records video during motion events
5. **Cleanup**: Removes old recordings to save disk space

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Webcam access
- Internet connection for Telegram notifications
- OpenCV compatible camera
- FFmpeg (for audio/video merging)

## Development

### Install in Development Mode

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd webcam-security
pip install -e .
```

### Run Tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```
